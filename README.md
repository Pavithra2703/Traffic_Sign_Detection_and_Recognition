Designed a deep learning-based system to detect and classify traffic signs using Google Colab, OpenCV, and Keras (TensorFlow backend). 
The project includes a preprocessing pipeline with techniques like Gaussian Blur and color segmentation to enhance image clarity and reduce noise.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a labeled traffic sign dataset to accurately recognize various sign categories. 
The system processes real-time images or video frames and outputs the detected sign with its classification, showcasing skills in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time image analysis.
